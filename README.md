# Gloo

## To Do

- move the blocks with the flow as erosion for first few frames
- stop generation if center is too busy
- speed-dependent light flicker (oxidation style)
- add position damping and reduce solver rigidity to help otherworldliness
- use dithering
- vertical emissions (up and down), simulate passing through Perlin field like smoke
- spiral arrangement?
- credit
